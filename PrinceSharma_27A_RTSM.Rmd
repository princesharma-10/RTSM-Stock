# Forecasting with Time-Series Data (Univariate) : Procedure
# **********************************************************

# Given an Univariate Time-Series Data, Perform the following Analysis :

# Step 1 : Check for (Weak) Stationarity :: Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test
# If [Data] Stationary, Proceed to Step 2
# If [Data] Non-Stationary, Use Transformation (such as First/Second/... Difference | Log | ...) to Transform the Data and Check for Stationarity (Step 1)

# Step 2 : Check for Autocorrelation :: Ljung-Box Test 
# If [Data | Transformed Data] Do Not Have Autocorrelation, proceed to Step 4
# If [Data | Transformed Data] Has Autocorrelation, Proceed to Step 3

# Step 3 : Model for Autocorrelation :: ARIMA Models
# Identify AR | MA Order in the [Data | Transformed Data] using PACF | ACF Plots
# Use ARIMA(p, d, q) with Appropriate AR Order (p-Lags) | d-Degree of Differencing | MA Order (q-Lags) using PACF | ACF Information to Model the [Data | Transformed Data]
# Test for Autocorrelation in the [Residual Data 1] | If the ARIMA Model is Appropriate : No Autocorrelation in the [Residual Data 1] | If Autocorrelation in [Residual Data 1], Remodel the [Data | Transformed Data]
# Proceed to Step 4

# Step 4 : Check for Heteroskedasticity :: ARCH LM Test
# If [Data | Transformed Data] (Step 2) | [Residual Data 1] (Step 3) Do Not Have Heteroskedasticity, Proceed to Step 6
# If [Data | Transformed Data] (Step 2) | [Residual Data 1] (Step 3) Has Heteroskedasticity, Proceed to Step 5

# Step 5a : Model for Heteroskedasticity in [Data | Transformed Data] (Step 2) :: GARCH Models
# If Mean of [Data | Transformed Data] (Step 2) != 0 : De-Mean & Square the [Data | Transformed Data] | If Mean of [Data | Transformed Data] (Step 2) = 0 : Square the [Data | Transformed Data] 
# Identify ARCH | GARCH Order in the using GARCH Function
# Use GARCH(p,q) with Appropriate ARCH Order (p-Lags) | GARCH Order (q-Lags) to Model the [Data | Transformed Data]
# Test for Autocorrelation & Heteroskedasticity in the [Residual Data 2] | If the GARCH Model is Appropriate : No Autocorrelation & Heteroskedasticity in the [Residual Data 2] | If Autocorrelation & Heteroskedasticity in [Residual Data 2], Remodel the Squared [Data | Transformed Data]
# End of Analysis

# Step 5b : Model for Heteroskedasticity in [Residual Data 1] (Step 3) :: GARCH Models
# Identify ARCH | GARCH Order in the using GARCH Function
# Use GARCH(p, q) with Appropriate ARCH Order (p-Lags) | GARCH Order (q-Lags) with ARIMA(p, d, q) Model (in Step 3) in the Mean Equation to Model the [Residual Data 1] 
# Test for Autocorrelation & Heteroskedasticity in the [Residual Data 2] | If the ARIMA+GARCH Model is Appropriate : No Autocorrelation & Heteroskedasticity in the [Residual Data 2] | If Autocorrelation & Heteroskedasticity in [Residual Data 2], Remodel the [Residual Data 1]
# End of Analysis

# Step 6 : Model White-Noise Data 
# If the [Data | Transformed Data] is Stationary, Has No Autocorrelation & Heteroskedasticity, the [Data | Transformed Data] is White-Noise Data
# Model White-Noise Data with Appropriate Probability Distribution
# End of Analysis
